# Protein-Calculator

Protein-Calculator is a simple program that can be used to compute various properties and features of any protein by its sequence. The Programme output provides total number of Amino Acids present in the sequence, Molecular Weight of the protein in Dalton(Da), Grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) scores and sites of commonly occurring Post Translational Modifications (Glucosylation, Phosphorylation and Methylation). Protein Calculator also classifies the amino acids as polar, non-polar, acidic and basic and calculates the numbers and percentage for each of the amino acids. 

To Run:
1. Run the code normally as python script. 
2. Obtain the protein sequences form Protein NCBI database(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein), Protein data bank (https://www.rcsb.org/) or any protein sequence database. Retrieve the protein sequence in FASTA format. 
3. Paste the protein sequence obtained in FASTA format at the input cell when asked and press enter (Paste only the protein sequence and remove the identifier header of the FASTA file in the input).
4. Reading the results.
   The successful execution of the code will give following results. 
   a) Number of Amino Acids
   b) Classification of Amino acids as Non polar Amino acids, polar Amino acids, Acidic Amino Acids, Basic Amino Acids and their details.
   c) Summary of amino acid composition
   d) Molecular Weight of the protein in Dalton(Da)
   e) Grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) scores.
   f) Possible Post Translational Modifications sites as Glycosylation sites, Phosphorylation sites and Methylation sites
